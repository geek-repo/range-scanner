# range-scanner
This tool is purely based on sockets and will be used to scan internal ip after compromising the target as not always we want to pivot and then scan with nmap it is very slow task to do in my view ..
# usage
python3 scanner.py

Note:-right now it will only scan port 80 as i orignally made this script to find open router panel on my isp network ;)
so you guys can make changes accordingly the port/ports you wanna scan
